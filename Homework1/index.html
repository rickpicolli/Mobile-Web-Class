                    <p>I am taking Computer Science classes at City College and my primary goal, at least for now, is to get the Web Application  Programming Certificate.</p>
                    <p>I went through a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp before and came to CCSF to continue learning, and I'd really love to become a Front End developer here in SF, and that's why I'm taking this class. </p>
                    <p>As a programmer,  I have some experience using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and from activities in class. </p>
